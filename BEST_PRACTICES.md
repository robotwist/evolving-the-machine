# Project best practices and standards

This document outlines the best practices and standards to be followed across all aspects of this project, ensuring high quality, security, and maintainability.

## 1. Clean code

*   **1.1 Naming conventions:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `calculateTotalPrice()` instead of `calc()`).
*   **1.2 Code formatting:** Adhere to ESLint configuration with React hooks rules, JSX accessibility standards, and Prettier for consistent formatting.
*   **1.3 Modularity:** Break down code into small, focused functions and modules.
*   **1.4 Error handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms, logging errors appropriately.
*   **1.5 Code comments:** Use comments judiciously to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.

## 2. Systems design

*   **2.1 Architecture principles:** Follow layered architecture with clear separation: React UI → API Routes → Services → Database. Use lazy loading for components and memoization for performance.
*   **2.2 Design patterns:** Utilize Context API for authentication, Higher-Order Components for error boundaries, and Service Layer pattern for database operations.
*   **2.3 Scalability:** Design components to scale horizontally using Railway auto-scaling, PostgreSQL connection pooling, and component-based architecture for easy feature additions.
*   **2.4 Reliability:** Implement fault tolerance and resilience mechanisms.
*   **2.5 Security design:** Embed security considerations from the outset.

## 3. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

*   **3.1 Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML tags for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons).
*   **3.2 Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard alone.
*   **3.3 Color Contrast:** Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text and graphics.
*   **3.4 ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes to enhance semantics where native HTML isn't sufficient.
*   **3.5 Screen Reader Compatibility:** Test with screen readers to ensure content is accurately announced.

## 4. Security

*   **4.1 OWASP Top 10:** Prioritize addressing vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10.
*   **4.2 Secure Coding Practices:** Follow guidelines for preventing common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, XSS).
*   **4.3 API Security:** Implement authentication, authorization, and data validation for all APIs.
*   **4.4 Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## 5. SOC 2 compliance

*   **5.1 Data Handling:** Define policies and procedures for handling sensitive data (confidentiality, privacy).
*   **5.2 Access Control:** Implement strict access control mechanisms based on the principle of least privilege.
*   **5.3 Incident Response:** Develop and test incident response plans.
*   **5.4 Change Management:** Establish procedures for managing and documenting changes to the system.
*   **5.5 Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of system activity and security events.

## 6. Tools and workflow

*   **6.1 CI/CD Integration:** Integrate SAST, DAST, SCA, and accessibility testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **6.2 Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, including AI-generated code.
*   **6.3 Documentation:** Update this document regularly and ensure all new features and changes are documented.
