# Solution Summary: Unlock All Bug & White Screen Fix

## Problem Analysis

### Issue 1: `?unlock=all` Only Unlocking First Two Stages
**Root Cause**: The Zustand persist middleware was caching the `unlockedStages` value in localStorage. When the URL parameter was applied, it would set `unlockedStages: 8`, but on subsequent renders or page refreshes, the persisted value would override it.

**Why it failed**: The URL parameter logic ran once on mount, but the persisted storage would immediately restore the old value (which was likely `2` from beating the first stage).

### Issue 2: White Screen During Level Transitions
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
1. The game instance was being destroyed and recreated on every stage change
2. No visual feedback during the brief initialization period
3. Potential race conditions with async initialization
4. Memory leak in BaseGame's keyboard event listener

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Unlock All Feature (`App.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
if (unlock === 'all') {
  useGameStore.setState({ unlockedStages: 8 });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (unlock === 'all') {
  console.log('🔓 Dev Mode: Unlocking all stages');
  const store = useGameStore.getState();
  store.resetProgress(); // Clear persisted data first
  useGameStore.setState({ unlockedStages: 8, currentScreen: 'menu' });
  console.log('✅ All 8 stages unlocked:', useGameStore.getState().unlockedStages);
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Call `resetProgress()` first to clear stale persisted data
- Then set `unlockedStages: 8` to override
- Added console logs for debugging
- Removed duplicate `useEffect` that was causing confusion

### 2. Fixed Level Progression (`useGameStore.tsx`)

**Issue**: When completing a level, `goToNextStage()` would advance the stage but not unlock it, causing a mismatch.

**Before:**
```typescript
goToNextStage: () => {
  const { currentStage } = get();
  if (currentStage < MAX_STAGE) {
    set({
      currentStage: currentStage + 1,
      gameState: 'playing',
      currentScreen: 'game'
    });
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
goToNextStage: () => {
  const { currentStage } = get();
  if (currentStage < MAX_STAGE) {
    set((state) => ({
      currentStage: currentStage + 1,
      gameState: 'playing',
      currentScreen: 'game',
      unlockedStages: Math.max(state.unlockedStages, currentStage + 1)
    }));
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Now updates `unlockedStages` when advancing to ensure the next stage is accessible
- Uses `Math.max` to prevent unlocking from going backwards

### 3. Fixed Memory Leak in BaseGame (`BaseGame.ts`)

**Issue**: The keyboard event listener was added but never removed, causing memory leaks on level transitions.

**Before:**
```typescript
protected setupEventListeners() {
  document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    if (this.isRunning && !this.isPaused) {
      this.handleInput(e);
    }
  });
}

protected cleanup() {
  // Override in subclasses if needed
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
protected keydownHandler: ((e: KeyboardEvent) => void) | null = null;

protected setupEventListeners() {
  this.keydownHandler = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (this.isRunning && !this.isPaused) {
      this.handleInput(e);
    }
  };
  document.addEventListener('keydown', this.keydownHandler);
}

protected cleanup() {
  if (this.keydownHandler) {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', this.keydownHandler);
    this.keydownHandler = null;
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Store the handler in a class property so it can be removed later
- Properly remove the event listener in `cleanup()`

### 4. Improved Level Transition Handling (`GameCanvas.tsx`)

**Issue**: No visual feedback during game initialization, potential race conditions.

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!ctx || width === 0 || height === 0) return;
  
  const gameClass = gameMap[currentStage] || PongGame;
  const game = new gameClass(ctx, width, height);
  gameRef.current = game;
  
  game.onScoreUpdate = (score: number) => updateScore(currentStage, score);
  game.onGameOver = () => setGameState('ended');
  game.onStageComplete = () => {
    setGameState('stage-complete');
    useGameStore.getState().unlockNextStage();
  };

  Promise.resolve(game.init()).catch((error: Error) => console.error('Failed to initialize game:', error));
  game.start();

  return () => {
    game.destroy();
    gameRef.current = null;
  };
}, [currentStage, ctx, width, height, updateScore, setGameState]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const isInitializing = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!ctx || width === 0 || height === 0) return;
  if (isInitializing.current) return; // Prevent double initialization
  
  isInitializing.current = true;
  console.log(`🎮 Initializing game for stage ${currentStage}`);

  // Clear canvas before creating new game to prevent white screen
  ctx.fillStyle = '#000';
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

  const gameClass = gameMap[currentStage] || PongGame;
  const game = new gameClass(ctx, width, height);
  gameRef.current = game;

  game.onScoreUpdate = (score: number) => updateScore(currentStage, score);
  game.onGameOver = () => setGameState('ended');
  game.onStageComplete = () => {
    setGameState('stage-complete');
    useGameStore.getState().unlockNextStage();
  };

  // Initialize game asynchronously
  Promise.resolve(game.init())
    .then(() => {
      console.log(`✅ Game initialized for stage ${currentStage}`);
      game.start();
      isInitializing.current = false;
    })
    .catch((error: Error) => {
      console.error(`❌ Failed to initialize game for stage ${currentStage}:`, error);
      isInitializing.current = false;
    });

  return () => {
    console.log(`🧹 Cleaning up game for stage ${currentStage}`);
    game.destroy();
    gameRef.current = null;
    isInitializing.current = false;
  };
}, [currentStage, ctx, width, height, updateScore, setGameState]);
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added `isInitializing` ref to prevent race conditions
- Fill canvas with black before creating new game (prevents white flash)
- Better async handling with proper then/catch chains
- Added detailed console logs for debugging
- Ensure `isInitializing` is reset in all code paths

### 5. Added Storage Versioning (`useGameStore.tsx`)

Added version number to persist config to allow for future breaking changes:

```typescript
{
  name: 'cultural-arcade-game-store',
  partialize: (state) => ({
    unlockedStages: state.unlockedStages,
    stageAttempts: state.stageAttempts
  }),
  version: 1, // NEW
}
```

## Comparison to Best Practices (GameLevel Component Pattern)

### ✅ What We're Doing Right

1. **useRef for game state**: ✓ We use `gameRef` to store the game instance without triggering re-renders
2. **useEffect with cleanup**: ✓ Properly implemented in `useGameInstance` hook
3. **Game loop with requestAnimationFrame**: ✓ BaseGame uses RAF correctly
4. **Event listeners properly managed**: ✓ Now fixed with proper cleanup
5. **Separate render state**: ✓ Canvas size, ctx, and other render props are in useState
6. **Keyboard event handling**: ✓ Added/removed in setup/cleanup

### ⚠️ Areas for Further Improvement

1. **Level completion**: Currently handled via callbacks, could be more React-like with state machines
2. **Loading states**: Could add explicit loading UI during game initialization
3. **Error boundaries**: Should wrap game canvas in React error boundary
4. **Performance monitoring**: Could track frame times and warn on slow frames

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Unlock All Feature
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/?unlock=all`
2. Open DevTools Console
3. You should see: `🔓 Dev Mode: Unlocking all stages` and `✅ All 8 stages unlocked: 8`
4. Click "Select Stage" button
5. All 8 stages should be unlocked and clickable
6. Try clicking each stage - they should all work

### Test 2: Level Progression
1. Start fresh (clear localStorage or use incognito)
2. Beat Stage 1 (Pong)
3. Click "Next Stage"
4. You should be able to play Stage 2
5. Return to Stage Select
6. Stage 2 should now be unlocked
7. Continue this pattern through all 8 stages

### Test 3: White Screen Fix
1. Play through a complete level
2. Click "Next Stage"
3. You should see:
   - No white screen flash
   - Black canvas briefly
   - New game loads immediately
4. Check console for: `🎮 Initializing game for stage X` and `✅ Game initialized for stage X`

### Test 4: Memory Leak Fix
1. Open DevTools -> Memory tab
2. Take a heap snapshot
3. Play through 3-4 stages
4. Take another heap snapshot
5. Check for detached DOM nodes or event listeners
6. Should see proper cleanup (no memory growth beyond assets)
